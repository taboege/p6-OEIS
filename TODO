- Add tests and documentation. Allow offline testing by downloading
  some search results. But also test the webpage fetching features
  like pagination if NETWORK_TESTING is enabled. Convert most tests
  to use cached files, though.
- Update README.
- Check types of attributes in OEIS::Entry.
- Also think about returning a Failure when no or too many
  results were found. Use that to bisect a good value in the
  Seq multi candidate?
- Bump to v1.0.0, add :ver, :auth and :api.

- Add advanced search syntaxes.
- Can we use the `start` GET parameter to searches for seeking?
  Should that be supported?
