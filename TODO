- Complete tests.
- Complete documentation.
- Update README.
- Return a Failure instead of an empty Seq when no results are found?
  What about too many results? Either way, use these indicators to
  bisect a good value in the Seq multi candidate. Add a test.
- Bump to v1.0.0, add :ver, :auth and :api.

- Add advanced search syntaxes.
- Can we use the `start` GET parameter to searches for seeking?
  Should that be supported?
