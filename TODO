- Put OEIS::Keywords in the OEIS package and make them available
  directly from `use OEIS`. That's the only import one should need
- Make lookup("A000123") DWIM
- Handle errors, most those from OEIS' interface like "no results
  found" or "too many results found" or network errors from WWW.
  And, for example there is an "$!author required but not provided"
  error when I search long enough among the results for Fibonacci.
  Bug in OEIS? Also think about returning a Failure when no or too
  many results were found. Use that to bisect a good value in the
  Seq multi candidate?
- Make .crossrefs return a lazy list of OEIS::Entry objects
- Add tests and documentation. Allow offline testing by downloading
  some search results. But also test the webpage fetching features
  like pagination if NETWORK_TESTING is enabled
- Bump to 1.0.0, add :ver, :auth and :api

- Add advanced search syntaxes
- How to choose the number of elements from a lazy Seq to us
  in a query to the OEIS?
